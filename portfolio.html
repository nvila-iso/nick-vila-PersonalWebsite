            In Dungeon and Dragons terms, 'session zero' implies the part where
            the player creates their characters. While most D&D players leave
            this part up to their imagination, others like to have some visual
            guide to help feed their imaginations. In this application I use AI
            to help me generate the art style so I can focus on the
            functionality. It forces me to work heavily with JavaScript.

            One of my closets friends Youtube channels. I helped manage, produce
            and upload to youtube weekly for a while. Working together with
            friend was a great experience for me. Together we were able to
            achieve a lot. While he was the face of the channel I was the behind
            the scenes (preferably). It gave me the oppurtunity to learn about
            Youtube'system and more importantly how to expand on tools such as
            the Adobe Suite (Photoshop / Premiere / After Effects) Most content
            on his page related to Street Fighter 6 is my handy work.

          <p>To further exercise my production skills I decided to make a quick video for a role-playing game called Mutant Crawl Classics. I used creative common (CC) footage and art, along with an AI generated voice over to piece these together. Sadly it never went anywhere but this was only for practice and to earn some more experience with AI tools.</p>
