            One of my favorite hobbies, video post-production using tools like
            Adobe Premiere and After Affects. I was fortunate enough to work
            with LI Joe, the FGC's most favorite underdog and EVO host for the
            past 5 years. Together we were capable of a high view count and a
            rapid growth in followers.

            One CRT, one VCR and over 500+ VHS tapes. Some may call it a problem
            but I call it a good time. It started off as a simple hobby but the
            hunt for a good flick rapidly became an addiction for more
            nostalgia. In the video above, my favorite podcast group read an
            email I wrote to them discussing my hobby. I couldn't have been more
            happier!

          <h2>Hydroponic Gardening</h2>
          <img src="https://i.redd.it/h7nkc4m2uoy81.jpg" alt="Hydroponic Tower">
          <p>Easily the most practical hobby I've ever picked up in my life. I'm fascinated by the science behind hydroponics. It's efficient, safe and incredibly therapeutic. I started this around 2019 - thank you COVID? 3D printed my own hydroponics tower and taught myself how to sustain healthy vegetables through much trial and error.</p>
