            One of my favorite hobbies, video post-production using tools like
            Adobe Premiere and After Affects. I was fortunate enough to work
            with LI Joe, the FGC's most favorite underdog and EVO host for the
            past 5 years. Together we were capable of a high view count and a
            rapid growth in followers.

            One CRT, one VCR and over 500+ VHS tapes. Some may call it a problem
            but I call it a good time. It started off as a simple hobby but the
            hunt for a good flick rapidly became an addiction for more
            nostalgia. In the video above, my favorite podcast group read an
            email I wrote to them discussing my hobby. I couldn't have been more
            happier!

            Easily the most practical hobby I've ever picked up in my life. I'm
            fascinated by the science behind hydroponics. It's efficient, safe
            and incredibly therapeutic. I started this around 2019 - thank you
            COVID? 3D printed my own hydroponics tower and taught myself how to
            sustain healthy vegetables through much trial and error.

            My father raised me to have an appreciation for music - no matter
            the genre. Teaching me various instruments and even taking me to see
            live music on occasion. Unfortunately my interests in playing music
            didn't last as long as I wish but my desire to find good tunes only
            grows stronger the older I get.
